# Loan Prediction Project

The Loan Prediction Project is a machine learning project designed to predict the eligibility of individuals for loans based on various factors. Leveraging the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, this project offers insights into the likelihood of loan approval by analyzing historical data.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Conduct in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand underlying patterns and relationships.
- **Model Training**: Utilize the KNN algorithm to train a predictive model on historical loan data.
- **Distance Metrics**: Implement two variations of the KNN algorithm with different distance metrics.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the performance of trained models using appropriate metrics.
- **Deployment**: Save trained models for future use and provide a script for seamless loan eligibility prediction.

## Structure

- **Data**: Contains datasets for training and testing.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and model training.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts for model training, prediction, and evaluation.
- **Models**: Saved models.
- **README.md**: Overview, installation, and usage guidelines.
- **requirements.txt**: List of dependencies.

## Usage

1. **Installation**: Clone the repository and install required packages.
2. **Training**: Run data preprocessing and model training script.
3. **Prediction**: Predict loan eligibility using the trained model on new data.
